This folder contains my personal notes on Linear Algebra, developed gradually as my understanding deepens through lectures, reading, and problem-solving.

These notes reflect how concepts became clear to me over time, focusing on intuition and understanding rather than memorization. Once a topic reaches sufficient clarity, I convert my handwritten notes into structured LaTeX documents and place them here.
