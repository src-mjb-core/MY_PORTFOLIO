# MY_PORTFOLIO
This repository serves as my primary intellectual portfolio and long-term knowledge base as I prepare for advanced research in Artificial Intelligence.

Unlike a conventional project repository, MY_PORTFOLIO focuses on foundational understanding rather than final results. It documents how abstract mathematical and algorithmic concepts evolve into clear intuition through derivations, visualizations, and computational exploration.

Each section combines:

Formal notes (LaTeX-based) to ensure rigor

Simple, interpretable code to explore and visualize concepts

Personal insights capturing conceptual breakthroughs and resolved confusions

The goal is not breadth, but depth: to build a transparent record of how I think, learn, and reason about the core ideas that underpin modern AI.
